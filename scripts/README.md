Our implementation of the required functions is in the file implementations.py
They are dependent of helpers.py that contains a few helping functions from the labs (such as batch_iter).


run.py is the program that yielded us our submission. 


project1.ipynb is the python notebook where we tested all our implementation and where we searched for the good parameters.
It is dependent of :

-cross_validation.py (which contains the functions related to the cross validation of our work)
-helpers.py (which contains a few helping  functions from the labs and a few normalizing functions)
-implementations.py (which contains our implementations)
-proj1_helpers (which contains the functions importing and exporting the data)
